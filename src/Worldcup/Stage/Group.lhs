A function "fixtures" generates all matches (non-repeating combinatorial pairs) for a given group of teams; that is, each team has one fixture against each of the other teams. For example, given a list of teams:

    fixtures [ AUS, BEL, COL, DEN ]

this function will return 6 fixtures:

     [ (AUS , BEL), (AUS , COL), (AUS , DEN), (BEL, COL), (BEL, DEN), (COL, DEN) ]

TODO: Add basic logic explanation

Any duplicate teams passed will be ignored (this is achieved by simply filtering out the duplicates before running the algorithm. In a case where it is not possible to make any pairs (e.g. the list contains only a single team), an empty list will be returned.
